<!-- For postdoctoral researchers, PhD students and master by research students, it is a place of free for you to find a roadmap on how to happily survive PhD and the job market! Contributions are welcomed! -->



Welcome to the Awesome Machine Learning Academics Roadmaps repository! This is a community-driven space designed especially for postdoctoral researchers, PhD students, and Masters by Research students navigating the realm of Machine Learning. Our mission is to support your academic journey, provide guidance on surviving your PhD, and help you prepare for the job market.

Here, you can find curated resources including roadmaps, tips, advice, and much more to foster your academic and professional development.

## What's Inside

1. **Surviving your PhD:** A comprehensive guide that gives you practical advice on how to navigate your PhD journey, from your first year to completion.
2. **Machine Learning Roadmaps:** Detailed paths to guide your learning, from beginners to advanced topics in Machine Learning.
3. **Job Market Preparation:** From CVs, cover letters, interview tips to job search strategies, we cover everything to help you land your dream job in Machine Learning.

  3.1 **CVs:** We prepared the academic CV template which is an amended version of the templates available on Overleaf by Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (http://www.rpi.edu/dept/arc/training/latex/resumes/) and Michael DeCorte. Please find it in **awesome-ML_academics_roadmaps/academic_cv**.
  
  3.2 **Job search:** We constantly upload the job search tip articles and notes written by ourselves and collected online. Huge thanks for all the people who are willing to share their experiences on academic job hunting! Please find them in **awesome-ML_academics_roadmaps/job_search_tips**.
